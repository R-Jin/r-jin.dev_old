[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a series of christmas-themed coding challenges. Each day in December a challenge releases until Christmas day. The challenges can be solved in any programming language and is a great way to practice and learn new coding techniques. 

Last year I tried [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021), 
but abandoned it due to lack of time. This year I am hoping to complete all the 
coding challenges. My programming language of choice this year is python.

[The source code for all the solutions will be available on Github](https://github.com/R-Jin/Advent-of-Code)
