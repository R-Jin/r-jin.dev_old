It is this time of year again. Advent of Code is back! Starting of with a little tricky but manageable day 1. 
This year I will attempt to solve the problems using the [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Just like last year the source code for all the solutions will be available on 
[Github](https://github.com/R-Jin/Advent-of-Code).
