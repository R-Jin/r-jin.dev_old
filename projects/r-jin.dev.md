This website was made in order for me to document things I find interesting 
and also showcase my work.

# Techincal Details
This website is written using the ReactJS framework [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) 
and TailwindCSS. The markdown posts are transformed using [remarkjs](https://remark.js.org/), 
a markdown processor powered by plugins. Additionally the animations where created with the help of 
[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) and I also made an dark mode toggler for the site.
